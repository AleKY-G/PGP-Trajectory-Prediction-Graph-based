## Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Conditioned on Lane-Graph Traversals






This repository contains code for ["Multimodal trajectory prediction conditioned on lane-graph traversals"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15004) by Nachiket Deo, Eric M. Wolff and Oscar Beijbom, presented at CoRL 2021.  

**Note:** While I'm one of the authors of the paper, this is an independent re-implementation of the original code developed during an internship at Motional. Hope this helps!
